# Laboration-2
1DV610 Laboration 2

This is the second Lab in the course 1DV610, Software Quality.
In this lab we were tasked with creating a module that we will use in an app later in the course. 
We also focused on the code quality guidelines in the book Clean Code by Robert C. Martin and used this in our reflections and work on the module.

I chose to create a text analysis module that helps you analyse a block of code that the user inputs in a text input field.
It will help you count the words in your text, create a word cloud from the text you provided, and find out how many times a specified letter was used. And many more things.
