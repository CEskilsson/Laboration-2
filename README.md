## **Vision**
I wanted to create a simple journal app that utilises the Text Ananysis module I had earlier created. This was to see how I could use the methods I had made in the module in a actual app. 

I chose to make this very simple little journal app. Here you can write down your thoughts, poems or anything you would like. 

## How to use the app:
When you first enter the app you will see two input fields, one for the title of your entry and one for the actual entry. Just write what you want in the entry and click the "Add Entry" button to add the entry to your list of entries. 
After you have added an entry to the list you will have two buttons next to the entry, "Stats" and "Delete". Here you can display the stats of your entry or delete an entry. 
The entries will be saved in your local storage so your entries will not disapear when you close the app. 

## What does it do?
The app allows you to write a journal entry with a title. The entry will then be displayed in a list of all your entries. 
You can then choose to delete the entry or click the stats button to see some stats about your chosen entry. The stats are a word count, period count <-----ADD MORE



## **How to start the app:**
After you have cloned the repository you can open the app from VSCode with the Live Server extension

Then in the bottom right of the editor, you should have this a Go Live button:

While in the index.html file click this button and the app will start up in your chosen browser.

## How can you contribute?
The code is there for you to tinker with if you want. It's still a very simple journal app and of course there's room for endless possibilities.
