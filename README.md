# Text Analysis Module

## **Description**
This is the second Lab in the course 1DV610, Software Quality.
In this lab we were tasked with creating a module that we will use in an app later in the course. 
We also focused on the code quality guidelines in the book Clean Code by Robert C. Martin and used this in our reflections and work on the module.

I have made a text analysis module that will help you analyse your text in different ways. 

## What does it do?
This module has a few different tools to help you analyse your text. 

 - Count the words in your text.
 - Count the periods in your text.
 - Calculate how long the longest word in your text is.
 - Calculate how short the shortest word is.
 - Calculate the average length of the words used in your text. 
 - Count how many times a specific letter was used.
 - It can generate a list where it sorts the words from most used to least as well as displays how many times the word was used. 
 - It can generate a word cloud made from the words in your text.

Example from test app:

## **How to use the test app:**
After you have cloned the repository you can open the test app from VSCode with the Live Server extension

Then in the bottom right of your editor, you should have this a Go Live button:

While in the index.html file click this button and the test app should start up in your chosen browser.

## How to use the module:
Take the text-analysis-function.js and place it in your project. 
You then import it as a class and instantiate it.
For example like this:
