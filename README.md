# Text Analysis Module

## **Vision**
I have made a text analysis module that will help you analyse your text in different ways. 
I wanted to create tools that can both help in analysing our texts and also make it more fun to write texts. 
In this module there are several different tools that can help you analyse your text, you do not need to use all of them of course.
There is a wide variety of tools since we all want different things.  

## How to use the module:
Take the text-analysis-function.js and place it in your project. 
You then import it as a class and instantiate it.
For example like this:

You are the free to use it in your own projects and you can of course take only the parts that you need.

## What does it do?
This module has a few different tools to help you analyse your text. 

 - Count the words in your text.
 - Count the periods in your text.
 - Calculate how long the longest word in your text is.
 - Calculate how short the shortest word is.
 - Calculate the average length of the words used in your text. 
 - Count how many times a specific letter was used.
 - It can generate a list where it sorts the words from most used to least as well as displays how many times the word was used. 
 - It can generate a word cloud made from the words in your text.
